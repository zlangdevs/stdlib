# Zlang stdlib

Repo for zlang standart library. Currently WIP. 

Library can be written with zlang or any language binary compatible with zlang (or c). In case if the implementation is not written with zlang, you should put implementation in the same place where .zl interface is located and name implementation the same way. 

## TODO
- [ ] Tests
